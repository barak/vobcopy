Changelog for vobcopy:
For more infos on the options see "man vobcopy"
1.2.0:  Some new features!
	-Progress bar and speed enhancements/system load reduction
	coming with it - many thanks to Eric Kilfoil!
	-Vobcopy can now "rip" from an iso image on hdd or a directory
	containing a VIDEO_TS directory. People seem to need this for
	streaming dvd content to a ps3 via fuppes. That part seem to
	be buggy though, works 50/50. Will look further into that.
	-Option -M to rip the title with the longest playing time.
	-Other small corrections I think.

1.1.2:  German l12n in the program
	added [x]overwrite all option
	small fixes, e.g. for *bsd

1.1.1:	Apply patch by Petr Salinger for GNU/kFreeBSD

1.1.0:	Fixes debian bug #448319/CVE-2007-5718
	MacOSX (at least 10.5) compiles again
	other small fixes 

1.0.2:  I fixed a segfault in the log file writing routine. Otherwise
	small fixes and experimental "step over the bad part" code.

1.0.1:	I may have gcc-3.4, not the whole world :) Fix in Makefile.
	choose the right dvd device from fstab (Jens Seidel)
	read only as many blocks as there are actually left (Ingo Saitz)
	partial fix for detection of full nfs files (Robert Story)
	
1.0.0:  Yay! 1.0.0! Only some minor cleanup and some minor bugfixes. Still
	not perfect but good enough to enter "maintainance mode". vobcopy2 is
	being worked on!

0.9.0-pre1:  Lordy told me that checking return values from library calls is a
	good idea - and I have to confirm :)
	the configure.sh script now also looks if this is an ia64/AMD64
	system and use the lib64 libraries then - thanks to Steven A. Falco
	-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 is strange, 3 bytes won't fit into a char[4]
	then. Well, they fit into char[8]... Some people wrote in with
	this, gonna name Peter Czanik because he had the fix :)
	Fergal Daly taught me about the finer parts of sprintf, I took some
	of his advice...
	fixed double space detection on MacOSX, hopefully... thanks Bob Maguire

0.5.16: added some code to make -n and -m mutually exclusive
	the size-checking code with -m was br0ken. Fixed hopefully
	typo in the man-page

0.5.15: with -m, if files exist you now have the option to [s]kip the files
	already present - by patch from Guy Naor
	some dvd's show files ending in ";?", they should now work.
	
0.5.14: some more cleanup. Another small fix for different freebsd versions. Nothing major.

0.5.14-rc1:
	lots of bug fixes for *bds, solaris and -tada- OSX!
	Quite some stuff should now work better on freebsd, openbsd and
	solaris since Takeshi Nakamura provided some patches. Also
	incorporated the fix the netbsd folks did when they incorporated 
	0.5.13 into their ports collection. AND it seems that OSX now 
	works (besides fink, which provided vobcopy for quite some time 
	already). What is needed is dlcompat IIRC. Thanks to all for their help!

0.5.14-test1:
	changed dvd name getting function to what Jim Hatfield found works
	for freebsd
	Davide has a dvd which has names like this:
	VTS_01_2.VOB;?
	A new routine tries to remove the ;?.
	On OSX, getopt.h doesn't get found. /usr/include/getopt.h should do it
0.5.13: start for copying routine adjusted to the culmulative size of the
	previous files (via stat). Patch from Andrew Leiserson did fix the same.
	patch from Mark Prusinowski:
	"This fails to work in my case as I don't have the mount point
	 listed under /etc/fstab.  I manually mount the drive.  I created
	 a patch that uses libc's getmntent() to retrieve the desired
         information directly from /etc/mtab"

0.5.12: good old off-by-one error in the -m function fixed

0.5.11: -O vts_01_4 -o - didn't write to stdout but rather to the files.
	Fixed.
	Also did info texts of vobcopy end up in stdout streams. Now all go
	to stderr.
	New option: -q (quiet): all info- and error-texts of vobcopy end up
	in /tmp/vobcopy.bla
	thanks to Dimitrios Apostolou

0.5.10: e.g -O vts_01_4 now actually copies 4, not 1 like it did before
	    thanks Stewart Andreason
	some other cleanup
	    
0.5.9: -F now needs speed factor in range 1 .. 64 and this is enforced..
       new spec file (again?) - Florin Andrei
       
0.5.9-pre2: code cleanup and small bugfix - suggested by Ashley Martens

0.5.9-pre1: -O has now globbing function and separation of files has to be ","
	    rename instead of link/unlink on e.g. smb

0.5.8: added -O option ("one" file copying)
       some fixes for solaris
       some support for darwin, i.e. MacOSX
       Added code to name the files .partial at first and rename if
       size is ok
       [Error] and [Hint] cleanup
       stupid error fixed for mandrakes supermount (there is no iso9660 or
       udf in the mount command...)

0.5.7: 32 spaces as name if no name is present on dvd is fixed
       fast switch (-F) added 
       d_name[k] wasn't zero terminated, sometimes leading to garbled names.
       
0.5.6: fixed parsing of fstab and mtab on supermount using systems like
       Mandrake

0.5.5: Erik Hovland made some extensive patches to get vobcopy to work on
       solaris. Yeeha, another platform. Thanks a lot Erik!
       -bugfix: -f didn't work right
       
0.5.4: HIYAMA Takeshi did it again, patches for FreeBSD:
       dvd device detection should now work if I gather it correctly
       output of the log file should now work too

0.5.3: -t can now be provided for -m too to change the name of the output dir
       large-file support for FreeBSD (other *bsd?) added
       getopt-long fix for FreeBSD
       All these done by HIYAMA Takeshi

0.5.2: -major bug in mirror code removed (see Release-Notes)
       -added stuff for debian packaging
       -v -v fixed
       -now stops cleanly even if forced and no space left
       
0.5.1: -removed forgotten debug code
       -console doesn't get spammed anylonger with -m
       -m outputs now to DVD_NAME/VIDEO_TS/VTS...
       (except DVD_NAME now all uppercase since that is necessary to be able
       to burn it to dvd)
       -percent output to -m added
       -progression bar output now in MB rather than blocks for normal copy
       -removed lots of compiler warning (-Wall -pedantic)
       
0.5.0:	OK, some steps closer to what I want to have: There is now the -m 
	(--mirror) option which mirrors the dvd/video_ts/ content to a dir 
	created with the name of the dvd. The vobs are decrypted though.
	Also long-options have been added (--Info), look in the man-page.
	Some cleanup and bug-fix too.

0.4.3: -HIYAMA Takeshi ported my baby to FreeBSD (I sure hope it works there
       ;-)

0.4.2: 	-small bugfix for systems using devfs. 
	-new option -t name: You can specify the name of the output file if 
	you don't like the one from dvd or, if you want to pipe the output 
	someplace, say "-t stdout".
	
0.4.1:	-small bugfix: there is a include at the beginning of 0.4.0 that`s not
	met by a standard install of libdvdread.
	-more options: -b size[bkmg]
	begins to copy from the specified offset-size. Modifiers like b for 
	512-bytes, k for kilo-bytes, m for mega- and g for giga-bytes can be 
	appended to the number. Example: vobcopy -b 500m will start to copy 
	from 500MB onward till the end.
	-e size[bkmg]
	similar to -b, this options lets you specify some size to stop before 
	the end.
	-vobcopy takes the title with the most chapters by default if no title
	is specified
	
0.4.0:  behind -1, -2, -3 and -4 you can specify auxiliary/alternative 
	directories (but you have to take -o first) where the data will be 
	written to. The data will be split to fit on the first (-o) and 
	continued on the second (-1) ...
	(beware: the path probably has to be specified *directly* behind the 
	number like this -1/tmp/ and might even then be necessary to to this 
	to -o too)
	I gives you information about the titles, chapters and angles on the 
	dvd.
	Code-specific: Moved some things into separate functions to clean up 
	the code a little bit.
	
0.3.0: 	vobcopy has now the ability to work on it's own, meaning you can call 
	it simply by "vobcopy" and it will find the mounted dvd and copy the
	first title to the directory you called vobcopy from. Alternatively 
	some command line options emerged:
	-l for large file support (i.e. file output to larger than 2 GB)
	-i /path/to/the/mounted/dvd/ (if vobcopy doesn't do it correctly)
	-v being a little bit more verbose
	-v -v writing a log-file for bugreports to /tmp/
	-h prints help for all the options
	-f force vobcopy to write to a directory even if it thinks there isn't
 	enough space left
	-V prints the version number

	There have even been some efforts to get it to work under solaris, how
	far this actually works is unknown. Give it a try.
	
0.2.0: 	Included the -o option to specify the destination directory. The title-
	number has to be given now behind -n  

0.1.1: 	Added the Makefile and alternative_programs.txt

0.1.0: 	Now the program checks in advance if on the destination drive (the
	directory from which you call vobcopy) is enough free space. It then 
	gives you something like a progression indicator and at the very end it
	compares the size of what has been copied against the combined size of
	the title-vobs on dvd.

0.0.4: 	copies the decrypted vobs in 2 GB chunks to harddisk into files named
	after what could be extracted from the dvd (the dvd-title). File names
	are something like: wow-a-movie1_1.vob, wow-a-movie1_2.vob and so forth

0.0.2 - 0.0.3: dunno what happened there, don't remember

0.0.1: 	against all expectations on my side (I'm a lousy newbie programmer)
	this thing actually works! Thanx libdvdread guys.
